## 1. Node
- each Node has multiple Pods on it 
- Below 3 process must be installed on every node
- 1. Container Runtime
- 2. Kubelet : It interacts with both-the container and node. It is responsible for taking configuration and running pod with cointainer inside and assigning resources from Node to container(eg. CPU, RAM, ROM)
- 3. Kube proxy : 
   - Kube proxy forwards the requests.
   - its job is to look for new services and every time new services created, it creates a appropriates the rules on each node to forward traffic to those services to backend pods.
   - it make sure low network overhead eg. If my-app on node1 want to access database, it will not forward that request randomly to any node instead it will forward the request to database(pod) on same node
