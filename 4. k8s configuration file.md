## 3. Status : 
It is automatically generated by k8s and it is stored in ETCD. It continuously monitor the records of running pods and compare it with configuration file. e.g. If status found 2 replicas of any deployments are live however in configuration file it is mentioned 3 replicas, then it will create 1 more replica. This is what we call self healing.
